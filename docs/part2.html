      I guess I do recognize that I’m being kind of unfair. The reality is probably that tons of people would love to be this more empathetic or more understanding versions of themselves, but they just can’t, whether it’s because of past traumas, or because of the constant exhaustion induced by capitalism, or simply because they’ve never learned how.

      I think shame and insecurities play a lot into this. When you’re constantly battling your insecurities, even a mild insinuation that you have a better understanding (which I think is just... true of everyone in the world) can feel like a personal attack. Someone might just be trying to understand you, but it can feel like they’re coming after you. Maybe previous relationships taught you that mutual understanding leads to manipulation. Maybe previous relationships taught you that vulnerability leads to shaming and criticism. These are unfortunately realities that people continue to live out, even after they’ve left whatever bad situation they were in before.

      It’s also possible that people simply don’t know how to gain better understanding and empathy. American culture didn’t ingrain a lot of us with an innate understanding of healthy and effective communication. Hell, plenty of american boys make it as far as college and beyond without learning any way of communicating affection besides insulting one another. To a significant degree, the media only enforces this. Reality TV and dramas show a million ways to escalate things until they become explosive and almost no ways of resolving things with calm, peaceful understanding.

      In my head, the most reliable way of getting around both of these things is getting help from other people. Unfortunately, both of those things also get in the way of asking other people for help! A lot of people seem to get feelings of shame around asking for help. A lot of people seem to think it’s not OK to ask for help or that it reflects badly on them to ask for help. It’s not true! Asking for help is super important and super valuable! You can do so much more when you get help from others than you can on your own. A lot of the time, people are even eager to help you!

      However, i get that, even if you know these things, you might still not be able to get past this wall. You might not have the energy for it, or you might have a mental blocker stopping you from seeking proactive communication. We all have busy lives and we all have our own things that we’re concerned about.

      Maybe, given the state of the world, this is just the best that we can do?
