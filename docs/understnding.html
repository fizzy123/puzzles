      My life is full of people who are willing to work with me and understand me. Even when it feels like I’m speaking another language or even when I do something <i>verboten</i>, the people in my life are willing to work around my mistakes and be there for me. People are capable of figuring out how to support you and be there for you, no matter how obtuse or puzzling the process might seem. I’ve seen this first hand in my own life and, I think if we keep trying to understand one another, we’ll continue to get better and faster at being able to reach each other.
