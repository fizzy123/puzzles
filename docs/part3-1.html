      Wait a second. I don’t know why I’m talking so cynically. Looking out at the world and only looking at the terrible things that are happening throughout the world and seeing the worst of how people interact with one another can give you a perspective that people just don’t care and seeing mistake after mistake after mistake can convince you that people just aren’t capable....  but my life’s not like that at all. I already know a ton of people who are amazing about working to understand others and are trying to get better at understnding others everyday.
